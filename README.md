Web-Based Systems Project.

The project is a web application developed using Spring Boot(Java) and ReactJs,
the application uses data about Formula One drivers and teams, from DBpedia and
represents a Linked Data application. This means that almost everything has a URI
which is a URL to the DBpedia data available online for the thing itself.
